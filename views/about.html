			<h1>Let's build something amazing.</h1>
      	<p>My name's Andrew and I'm passionate about Front-end development. I have a Bachelor's degree in Graphic Design and many hours of self-study under my belt. I currently live in Minneapolis, MN and work out of the <a href="http://cocomsp.com">CoCo</a> in Uptown. I'm an independent developer who enjoys helping agencies and companies build beautiful web experiences.</p>

I also have experience working with Wordpress and Shopify too. Feel free to take a look at my skill set below.</p>
