      	<p>It's nice to meet you. My name's Andrew and I'm an independent developer who enjoys helping agencies and companies build beautiful web experiences. I have a Bachelor's degree in Graphic Design and many hours of self-study under my belt. I currently live in Minneapolis, MN and work out of the <a href="http://cocomsp.com">CoCo</a> in Uptown.</p>

      	<p>I specialize in <i class="highlight">JavaScript</i> <i class="highlight">CSS</i> <i class="highlight">HTML</i> and <i class="highlight">Wordpress</i>. I particularily enjoy building responsive sites and working with JavaScript frameworks like Angular. I also have experience working with Wordpress and Shopify as-well.
